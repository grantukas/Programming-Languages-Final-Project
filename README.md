## __Why we chose Swift__ 

Mobile apps and games are something that many interact with everyday. In addition, mobile app development sounds like a field worth touching upon given the widespread popularity of these mobile devices. Besides this popularity, mobile app development just sounds like a really fun field to be in, because you get the opportunity to see your code and graphics work hand in hand to produce a highly interactable piece of software, such as a small game, or a food app, etc. Swift is a programming language that has been designed for the development of mobile apps and games for iOS devices, so this is why we decided to pick this as our programming language.

## __A Overview on the History of Swift__

Swift is a very young object oriented programming language that incorporates various ideas from Objective-C, Python, C# and more, with the very first version being announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2014 (1, 2). Actual development of the Swift programming language was started in 2010 by Chris Lattner, with apple programmers joining the following year (1). Prior to swift, Objective-C was used to develop apps for apple devices, but Apple began to have concerns over the low safety level of Objective-C. Objective-C, being extremely close to C, ran the risk that a careless programmer may write a piece of software that accesses the incorrect memory addresses, which could lead to crashes and even security concerns (3). This low level of safety, combined with the increasing hardship of adding in new features that other programming languages were adopting with ease, motivated apple to search for a new programming language, leading them to Swift. Since version 1, swift has undergone major growth, with numerous versions being released. Swift has also been well received by developers around the world, coming in first place for the most loved language in 2015 (4). Swift also became an open source project in 2015, with the aim of advancing the original goals of making a language that is safe, fast, and is expressive (5). In 2016 the first version of Swift as an open source project, Swift 3, was released (5). The most current version of Swift is version 5.1.2, with Swift 5.2 in the works (5).

## __The type of tasks is Swift suitable for__

Developed by Apple in order to provide developers with a faster, safer, more reliable way to write software, Swift is used in order to create applications for all Apple platforms. This includes iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Swift was developed by Apple as a replacement for C-base languages such as C, C++, and Objective-C, meaning it is capable of performing similar tasks. It was however, created in order to be a faster alternative to Objective-C that also benefits from an ease of learning, simpler code, safety, and its interactivity. Because of these reasons, especially its simplicity, it is especially popular among start-up companies and beginning developers. Also, the fact that Swift can serve as both a forward-facing and server side language, it is beneficial to companies because for a product such as Facebook, apps and servers can speak to each other seamlessly (11). Lots of applications currently available for iPhones, iPads, and other iOS devices utilize Swift in their code. Although they are not written entirely in Swift, programs such as Firefox, Wordpress, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Venmo, etc all utilize Swift (10). In addition to iOS app development, the language can also be used on Linux in order to build Swift Libraries.
